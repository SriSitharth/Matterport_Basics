# Basic Matterport Projects

Welcome to the repository for our Basic Matterport Projects! This project is designed to demonstrate basic functionality using the Matterport SDK, including tagging, staging, and getting the pointer location.

## Features

    Pointer Location: Retrieve the pointer location within the 3D model to provide additional context in the UI.
    Multi-Model Staging with Pointer: Extend staging functionality to support multiple Matterport models, allowing users to stage and interact with multiple models.
    Split-Screen View: Enable a split-screen view to compare different sections or viewpoints of the Matterport model simultaneously.
    Staging in Code: Utilize code to programmatically stage the Matterport model.
    Tagging: Implement tagging functionality to associate PDFs, videos, and photos with specific locations within Matterport models.
    Staging with Pointer: Allow users to interactively stage the model using a pointer, selecting areas of interest for further exploration.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Basic Matterport Project:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Obtain access to the Matterport SDK and API documentation to understand how to integrate with the Matterport platform.
    Customize the JavaScript files to interact with the Matterport SDK and implement tagging, staging, and pointer location functionality.
    Customize the HTML and CSS files to design the user interface and styling of the application.
    Test the application locally to ensure functionality and responsiveness.

## Usage

    Pointer Location: Retrieve the pointer location within the 3D model to provide additional context or interaction.
    Navigation: Use intuitive controls provided by the Matterport SDK to navigate and interact with the 3D model.
    Split-Screen View: Enable a split-screen view to compare different sections or viewpoints of the Matterport model side by side.
    Tagging: Use the tagging functionality to associate PDFs, videos, and photos with specific locations within the Matterport model for additional context or information.
